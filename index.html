                <p>
                    Get a range of fineness in your chopped pecans. You can use your food processor and pulse until there's a good mixture of powder-like pecans and crushed pecans. Bigger pieces provide crunch and texture; finer pieces provide better coverage for an even coating on your chicken bites. Don't skip out on the dipping sauce if you're a fan of honey mustard—it's the perfect condiment for these snackable bites!

                <p>
                    We are fortunate to have access to sushi grade raw fish, but you can still make sushi at home if you can’t find some. Shrimp tempura rolls are one of my favorites, or you could do a California roll or a veggie roll. One of our favorites is a Philly roll, with smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and cucumber.
